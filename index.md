_**[Real Estate Sale Price Prediction Model](model)**_

The above link shows python code for a model that predicts Real Estate Sale Prices for the given dataframe! As a Real Estate minor and someone who has interned in Real Estate brokerage, this was my personal favorite coding assignment to do.

_**[Wealth Management Dashboard](https://wealth-advisor-dashboard-zxeuck5wssugu23mf7cjon.streamlit.app/)**_

The link above leads to my team's final project for our FIN 377 class. We constucted a dashboard that acts as a wealth manager for its users. Users will take a short quiz and our dashboard will output an optimal portfolio of indices based on the user's preferences! Below is our initial rough sketch of our idea for the dashboard before we brought it to life through hours of collaboration, research, and writing python code.

_**[Marketing Brand Extension Project](/pdf/MKT_111.pdf)**_

This project was a group marketing final. We decided to do a brand extension for American Express by inventing the AMEX wallet. The concept is to combine your AMEX credit card and wallet into one, easy to use, metal, accessory. The prototypes we designed are shown below. In the link above, you can see all the aspects of our project such as the brand analysis, market research, advertising, financial analysis, and more!
