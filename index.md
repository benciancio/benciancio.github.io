## About Me
Hello!

I am a Junior at Lehigh University. I am currently majoring in Finance with a minor in Real Estate. As a student, I have always excelled when working with numbers and mathematics. I possess strong communication and leadership skills and I am looking for an internship in the Finance or Real Estate industries to grow my skills and experience.

## Portfolio

Below are a few projects I have worked on throughout my time at Lehigh.

<!-- You can link to other websites, PDFs in this repo, and other pages in this repo -->

_**[Real Estate Sale Price Prediction Model](model)**_

The above link shows python code for a model that predicts Real Estate Sale Prices for the given dataframe! As a Real Estate minor and someone who has interned in Real Estate brokerage, this was my personal favorite coding assignment to do.
